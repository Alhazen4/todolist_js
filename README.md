Simple To-Do-List Web App with JavaScript

NOTE:
This is a static To-Do-List Web App. So if you refresh the web, all of the to-do-list you inputted before will be lost.\
I have created the database connection to save every activity we input, it saved in the database but I become confused to how show the activities stored in the database to the website through JavaScript.
